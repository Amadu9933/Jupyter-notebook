    "- The programming community is not as diverse as it can be. Although things are improving, we should make more efforts to support & encourage underrepresented communities, whether in terms of age, country, race, gender, or otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Although most programmers hold a college degree, a reasonably large percentage did not have computer science as their college major. Hence, a computer science degree isn't compulsory for learning to code or building a career in programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A significant percentage of programmers either work part-time or as freelancers, which can be a great way to break into the field, especially when you're just getting started.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Javascript & HTML/CSS are the most used programming languages in 2020, closely followed by SQL & Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Python is the language most people are interested in learning - since it is an easy-to-learn general-purpose programming language well suited for various domains.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Rust and TypeScript are the most \"loved\" languages in 2020, both of which have small but fast-growing communities. Python is a close third, despite already being a widely used language.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Programmers worldwide seem to be working for around 40 hours a week on average, with slight variations by country.\n",
